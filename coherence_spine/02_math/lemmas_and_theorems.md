# Lemmas and Theorems (L1 → L5)

These are **engineering theorems**: they become enforceably true when their
preconditions are implemented as gates/rails/receipts.

## Setup
Discrete time steps:

x_{k+1} = Φ_{dt_k}(x_k) (proposed)

Accept/reject is determined by gate policy G and rails 𝒜.

Let C(x) be coherence debt.

### Assumption S1 (Bounded retries)
Each step attempt permits at most N_retry repairs.

### Assumption S2 (Contractive repair on success)
There exists γ ∈ (0,1) and b ≥ 0 such that for successful repairs:

C(x_repaired) ≤ γ C(x_failed) + b.

### Assumption S3 (Hard invariants enforced)
Any hard-invariant failure triggers rollback/abort; failed states cannot be accepted.

## Lemma 1 — No Silent Drift
If every attempt emits a receipt with residuals and decisions, then any long-run drift
has a first offending step k* whose receipt identifies the primary cause.

*Proof (direct):* receipts impose a total order of attempts; the first divergence must appear in a receipt.

## Lemma 2 — Hysteresis prevents chatter-as-default
With warn_exit < warn_enter and fail_exit < fail_enter, a gate can’t toggle rapidly
without the metric q crossing bands repeatedly; that behavior is measurable and can be gated
as operational defect r_ops.

## Lemma 3 — Bounded retries ⇒ bounded work inflation
If each attempt costs ≤ W and retries are capped by N_retry, then per-step work ≤ W(1+N_retry).
Coherence enforcement cannot create an infinite loop.

## Lemma 4 — Debt boundedness under contractive repair
If accepted steps satisfy C(x_k) ≤ C_max, and repairs satisfy S2, then along accepted steps:

C(x_k) ≤ max(C(x_0), C_max, b/(1−γ)).

*Proof idea:* apply the contractive inequality repeatedly; bound by a geometric series.

## Lemma 5 — Small-gain bound for coupled residual blocks
If ||r_A|| ≤ α||r_B|| + e_A and ||r_B|| ≤ β||r_A|| + e_B with αβ < 1, then:

||r_A|| ≤ (α e_B + e_A)/(1−αβ),
||r_B|| ≤ (β e_A + e_B)/(1−αβ).

## Theorem — Coherence Persistence Under Gated Evolution
Under S1–S3, if the gate policy enforces:
1) hard invariants on every accepted state,
2) debt bound C ≤ C_max on accepted states,
3) every failure is either aborted or repaired contractively (S2),

then:
- undefined states cannot be accepted silently,
- debt remains bounded on accepted steps,
- persistent drift is attributable to a bounded subset of residual terms recorded in receipts.
