# Glossary (Canonical)

**Coherence** — persistence of identity under evolution, quantified by residuals and enforced by gates.
**Residual r(x)** — measurable defect signal (physics, constraints, semantics, tools, ops).
**Debt C(x)** — scalar functional aggregating residuals + penalties into an acceptance currency.
**Gate** — pass/warn/fail rule (with hysteresis) producing accept/reject/abort decisions.
**Hard gate** — invariant that must never fail on accepted states.
**Soft gate** — quality threshold that triggers bounded repair + retry.
**Rails** — bounded corrective actions applied during repair.
**Receipt** — auditable record of attempt: state, metrics, decisions, actions, hashes, provenance.
**Hash chain** — tamper-evident linking of receipts.
**Projection rule** — declared layer mapping; illegal crossings are coherence violations.
