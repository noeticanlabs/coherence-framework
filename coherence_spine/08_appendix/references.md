This spine is deliberately “project-integratable”:

- **Layer stack + projection discipline:** aligns with the L0–L5 stack in the manifest.
- **Evolution-operator worldview:** plugs into any “one-line evolution law” (ODE/PDE/solver kernel).
- **Receipts as proof artifacts:** L4 runtime logs become L5 verifiable evidence.
