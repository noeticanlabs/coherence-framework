# coherence-framework
Coherence Governance Layer (CGL): budgeted stability for simulations. Tracks coherence debt (𝕮) and capacity (K), uses the Banker to accept/reject/correct steps with bounded actions, and logs hash-chained receipts (Ω-ledger) to detect “silent cheating” and enable reproducible runs. Coherence is a **governance-measurable integrity budget** consisting of a scalar debt \(\mathfrak C\) and a residual vector \(\mathbf r\), with gates, rails, and receipts. A system is **coherence-compliant** only if it produces replayable receipts and enforces bounded correction.
