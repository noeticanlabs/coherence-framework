# 13 Bridge Notes (Time / GR / PDE / AI)

## BRIDGE/UNVERIFIED Hypotheses
- **Time dilation as governance (CANON):** step-size control and retry semantics are governance artifacts.
- **Time dilation as physics (UNVERIFIED):** coherence directly induces physical time dilation.
- **GR/PDE analogies (UNVERIFIED):** coherence currents align with physical fluxes.

## Verification Path
For any bridge claim, provide:
1. **Derivation** with units and variable definitions.
2. **Mapping** between coherence quantities and physical quantities.
3. **Empirical checks** or simulation results.
4. **Receipt impact** (what new fields or residuals are required).

## Elevation Checklist
A BRIDGE claim can be promoted only if:
- It is derived and unit-consistent.
- It passes empirical checks.
- It improves predictive accuracy without violating gates.
