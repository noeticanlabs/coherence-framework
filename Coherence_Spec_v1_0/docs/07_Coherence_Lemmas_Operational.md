# 07 Coherence Lemmas (Operational)

Each lemma includes preconditions and a measurable conclusion. Each lemma must map to a CI test.

## Affordability Gate Lemma
**Preconditions:** Gate policy defined; hard/soft thresholds set.

**Conclusion:** All accepted states lie inside the policy-safe region.

**Test mapping:** Verify acceptance implies residuals and debt within thresholds.

## No-Smuggling Lemma
**Preconditions:** Receipts include rail actions with bounds.

**Conclusion:** All stability sources appear as bounded rails in receipts.

**Test mapping:** For each acceptance after mitigation, verify bounded rail entries exist.

## Anti-Chatter Lemma
**Preconditions:** Hysteresis thresholds and monotone mitigation policy defined.

**Conclusion:** Repeated retries cannot oscillate indefinitely at the threshold.

**Test mapping:** Simulate boundary conditions; confirm finite transitions.

## Termination Lemma
**Preconditions:** Bounded retries and minimum \(\Delta t\) floor.

**Conclusion:** Each step terminates in finite attempts (accept or abort).

**Test mapping:** Enforce retry cap and \(\Delta t\) floor in tests.

## Replay Lemma
**Preconditions:** Receipts contain state summary, residual vector, debt decomposition, gates, actions, decision, and hashes.

**Conclusion:** Replay reproduces decisions within tolerance.

**Test mapping:** Deterministic replay yields same acceptance and hashes.
