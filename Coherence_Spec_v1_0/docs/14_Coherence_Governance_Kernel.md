# Coherence Governance Kernel

Status: Canonical  
Scope: Mathematical → Lean → Runtime → Receipts → Forensics

## 1. Mission Statement

The **Coherence Governance Kernel (CGK)** is a formally governed execution framework for iterative systems. It enforces **stability**, **termination**, and **forensic accountability** using explicit inequalities, bounded corrective actions (rails), and auditable numeric receipts. Every accepted step is justified by a theorem-backed inequality; every failure implies a falsified assumption with a first witness.

This system is domain-agnostic and applies uniformly to numerical solvers (PDE, GR, YM), optimization loops, and hybrid symbolic–numeric reasoning systems.

---

## 2. Governing Definitions

### 2.1 State

A state is an element of an abstract space X. Concrete realizations include:

- Discrete PDE fields
- Constraint vectors
- Solver internal representations
- Reasoning context + memory

States are opaque to governance. Only **residuals** and **debt** are governed.

---

### 2.2 Residual Vector

For any state x ∈ X, define a residual vector:

r(x) = (r₁(x), r₂(x), …, rₘ(x)) ∈ ℝᵐ

Each residual component has:

- semantic meaning
- scale sᵢ > 0
- threshold τᵢ ≥ 0

Residuals are observable and domain-defined.

---

### 2.3 Scalar Debt Functional

Residuals are mapped to a scalar **debt** used by the scheduler:

C(x) = Σᵢ wᵢ (rᵢ(x)/sᵢ)² + Σⱼ vⱼ pⱼ(x)

Properties:

- C(x) ≥ 0
- C(x) = 0 indicates perfect coherence
- Scheduler logic depends *only* on C(x)

---

## 3. Actions

### 3.1 Proposal

A proposal is an unconstrained tentative update:

x → x′

Proposals are never trusted. They are always gated.

---

### 3.2 Repair (Rail)

A rail is a bounded corrective action:

x → R(x)

Examples:

- Projection
- Constraint damping
- Gauge fixing
- Filtering
- Backtracking

Rails are parameterized, finite, and logged.

---

## 4. Fundamental Contractive Inequality

Each rail R must satisfy the **contractive hypothesis**:

C(R(x)) ≤ γ C(x) + b

Where:

- 0 ≤ γ < 1 is the contraction factor
- b ≥ 0 is an irreducible noise floor

This inequality is the core invariant of coherence governance.

---

## 5. Feasibility and Fixed Point

Define the asymptotic floor:

C∞ = b / (1 − γ)

### Feasibility Condition

Acceptance threshold τ must satisfy:

τ > C∞

If violated, acceptance is provably impossible regardless of retries.

---

## 6. Iterated Dynamics

After k applications of R:

C(Rᵏ(x)) ≤ γᵏ C(x) + (1 − γᵏ)/(1 − γ) · b

This bound is formally proven and underlies termination guarantees.

---

## 7. Termination Theorem

If the feasibility condition holds, then there exists a finite k such that:

C(Rᵏ(x)) ≤ τ

Thus, retry loops are guaranteed to terminate unless assumptions are false.

---

## 8. Scheduler and Retry Cap

Define the minimal retry cap:

k_cap(x) = min { k | C(Rᵏ(x)) ≤ τ }

The scheduler retries at most k_cap times. Exceeding this cap implies a violated assumption.

---

## 9. Receipt System

### 9.1 Numeric Receipt Schema

Each attempt i emits a receipt containing:

- attempt_id
- C_before
- C_after
- gamma_i
- b_i
- tau
- tol
- optional residual vector rᵢ

All predicates are computed, not trusted.

---

### 9.2 Derived Predicates

- accepted(i): C_after ≤ tau
- ok(i): C_after ≤ gamma_i · C_before + b_i + tol

---

## 10. Forensics (No Silent Drift)

### 10.1 First Bad Attempt Theorem

If no attempt ≤ k_cap is accepted and at least one violates ok(i), then there exists a **first index** i₀ where ok(i₀) fails and all earlier attempts satisfy ok.

This index is guaranteed by well-ordering and is mechanically extractable.

---

### 10.2 First Bad Component

If a vector gate fails (∃j: |rⱼ| > τⱼ), then there exists a **first violating component index**. Failures localize to both time and component.

---

## 11. Heterogeneous Rails

Different attempts may use different (γᵢ, bᵢ). Define conservative bounds:

γ_max = max γᵢ  
b_max = max bᵢ

Then:

C_{k+1} ≤ γ_max C_k + b_max

All scheduler and forensic guarantees remain valid.

---

## 12. Coupled Subsystems (Small-Gain)

### 12.1 Two-Block Model

Let u, v ≥ 0 be block residual magnitudes. Suppose:

u′ ≤ a u + c v + eᵤ  
v′ ≤ b u + d v + eᵥ

Define debt:

C(u,v) = u² + v²

Then, if:

γ₀ = max(3(a² + b²), 3(c² + d²)) < 1

We have:

C(u′,v′) ≤ γ₀ C(u,v) + 3(eᵤ² + eᵥ²)

This theorem is fully proven in Lean and provides a conservative but sound reduction from vector coupling to scalar governance.

---

## 13. Domain Instantiations

### 13.1 General Relativity

Residual blocks:

- u = RMS Hamiltonian constraint
- v = RMS momentum constraint

Rails:

- Constraint damping
- Projection
- Gauge adjustment

Same contractive logic applies.

---

### 13.2 Yang–Mills

Residual blocks:

- u = Gauge violation
- v = Field equation residual

Rails:

- Gauge fixing
- Projection

Governed identically.

---

## 14. Directory Mapping (Canonical)

The repository layout mirrors this spine exactly and is required to maintain traceability:

- core/: state, residuals, debt, gates, rails
- scheduler/: feasibility, k_cap, policies
- receipts/: schema, emitters, I/O
- forensics/: first-bad scans, reports
- theory/: contraction, heterogeneous rails, small-gain
- domains/: GR, YM, toy systems
- lean/: formal proofs mirroring theory

No directory exists without a corresponding theorem or runtime invariant.

---

## 15. Definition of Coherence (Final)

A system is **coherence-governed** if:

1. Every accepted step satisfies an explicit inequality
2. Every retry is bounded and logged
3. Every failure implies a falsified assumption with a first witness

This is a mathematical, implementable, and auditable definition.

---

## 16. Closure

This document is complete. All extensions—physical, symbolic, cognitive—must embed into this spine without weakening its guarantees. Anything not expressible here is not yet governed.

End of specification.
