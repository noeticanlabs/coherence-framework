# 01 Coherence Principle

## Canonical Statement
**Principle of Coherence:** A system’s *predictive integrity* is governed by a measurable quantity (coherence) that can be **budgeted, transported, depleted, and stabilized** by bounded corrections whose costs are logged.

## Scope
This principle applies to:
- **Physical systems** (e.g., PDE solvers, control loops).
- **Symbolic systems** (e.g., theorem provers, planners).
- **Numerical solvers** (iterative updates).
- **AI reasoning systems** (tools, evidence, chain-of-operations).

## Three Laws (Budget, Transport, Governance)
1. **Budget / Balance:** Coherence is a finite budget \(\mathfrak C\) with residuals \(\mathbf r\) that must stay within policy bounds.
2. **Transport / Currents:** Changes in \(\mathfrak C\) must be attributable to proposals, corrections, and penalties.
3. **Governance / Affordability:** Every step must return **accept / retry / abort** based on declared gates and bounded rails.

## Non-Negotiable Rule
**Accepted evolution must remain inside declared safe region (gates).** If hard gates fail, the step is rejected regardless of other considerations.

## Operational Claim
Coherence is **not “truth.”** It is the *affordability condition* for taking a step or making a claim. Systems may be coherent and still be wrong; they are **governed and auditable** by receipts.
