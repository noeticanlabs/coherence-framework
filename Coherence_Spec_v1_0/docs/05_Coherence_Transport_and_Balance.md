# 05 Coherence Transport and Balance

## Discrete Balance (CANON)
Per step, the coherence change must be logged as:

\[
\Delta \mathfrak C = (\text{proposal cost}) - (\text{correction benefit}) + (\text{penalties})
\]

The receipt must record each term explicitly.

## Continuous Form (BRIDGE / optional)
A structural template for continuous systems:

\[
\partial_t C_{\text{loc}} + \nabla\cdot \mathbf J_C = \Sigma - D
\]

This is **BRIDGE/UNVERIFIED** unless derived and validated for a specific system.
