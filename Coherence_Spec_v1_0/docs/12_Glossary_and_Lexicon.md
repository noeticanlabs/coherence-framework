# 12 Glossary and Lexicon

## Canonical Terms
- **Coherence (CANON):** measurable governance budget; scalar debt \(\mathfrak C\) with residual vector \(\mathbf r\).
- **Residual (CANON):** measurable defect (constraint, consistency, reconstruction, tool mismatch, contradiction).
- **Debt (CANON):** scalar aggregation of residuals and penalties.
- **Gates (CANON):** hard/soft acceptance criteria.
- **Rails (CANON):** bounded corrective actions (reduce step, damp, repair, backtrack, evidence fetch).
- **Receipts (CANON):** immutable records of states, residuals, decisions, and actions.
- **Hysteresis (CANON):** separate enter/exit thresholds to avoid chatter.
- **Replay (CANON):** re-running with same inputs/config/seed reproduces decisions and hashes.
- **Certificate (CANON):** summary of run, maxima, hashes, and pass/fail.
- **Transport/Current (BRIDGE):** optional flow representation of coherence change.
- **Dissipation (BRIDGE):** reduction of debt via correction.
- **Reconstruction (CANON):** error between predicted and observed/checked state.
- **Contradiction (CANON):** logical or empirical inconsistency detected as residual.

## Naming Rules
- New terms must specify **CANON** or **BRIDGE/UNVERIFIED**.
- Definitions must include measurable criteria and associated receipt fields.
