# 03 Axioms and Postulates

## CANON Axioms (required)
**A1 Observability:** Coherence is computed from the current state (no future peeking).

**A2 Attribution:** Changes in coherence must be decomposable into named causes.

**A3 Bounded correction:** Every corrective action has declared bounds.

**A4 Affordability decision:** Each step returns **accept / retry / abort** with reasons.

**A5 Reproducibility:** Same inputs/config/seed yield equivalent receipts within tolerances.

## BRIDGE Postulates (optional / hypothesis)
These claims are **UNVERIFIED** unless derived and tested for a specific system:
- Coherence induces physical time or metric structure.
- Coherence currents are fundamental (rather than a governance artifact).
