# Coherence Spec v1.0

## Intent
Coherence in this specification is an **operational, measurable, auditable governance discipline**. It is defined as a *governance-measurable integrity budget* consisting of a scalar debt \(\mathfrak C\) plus a residual vector \(\mathbf r\). Systems declare gates and rails, emit receipts, and enforce bounded correction.

**Not included:** This spec makes **no metaphysical or physical claims** unless they are explicitly labeled **BRIDGE/UNVERIFIED** in the bridge notes. Coherence here is an *affordability condition* for steps and claims, not a statement of ultimate truth.

## Compliance Checklist (minimum requirements)
A system may claim **Coherence-compliant** only if it satisfies **all** of the following:
1. **Computes coherence**: emits a residual vector \(\mathbf r\) and scalar debt \(\mathfrak C\) per step.
2. **Enforces gates/rails**: hard gates must pass; soft policy must hold; rails are bounded.
3. **Produces receipts**: receipts are replayable and include gate decisions, residuals, debt decomposition, and bounded actions.
4. **Bounded correction**: corrective actions are bounded and logged.
5. **Deterministic replay**: same inputs/config/seed produce equivalent receipts within declared tolerances.

### Core statement (minimum)
Coherence is a **governance-measurable integrity budget** consisting of a scalar debt \(\mathfrak C\) and a residual vector \(\mathbf r\), with gates, rails, and receipts. A system is **coherence-compliant** only if it produces replayable receipts and enforces bounded correction.
