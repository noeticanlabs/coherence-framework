# Multiscale Barriers (Dyadic Tails + Slab Induction Template)

This section gives a reusable template for “preventing cascade” arguments:
you block energy from leaking into arbitrarily fine scales by proving a barrier inequality
that closes using dissipation at or above the target scale.

## 1) Dyadic decomposition
Let \(E_j(t)\ge 0\) be energy in band \(j\) (Littlewood–Paley, wavelets, shells).
Define tail energy:
\[
E_{\ge j}(t) := \sum_{k\ge j} E_k(t).
\]
Define tail dissipation (model-dependent) \(D_{\ge j}(t)\ge 0\).

## 2) Barrier form
A typical barrier statement is: there exists a computable function \(B_j(t)\) s.t.
\[
E_{\ge j}(t) \le B_j(t)\quad \forall t\in[0,T].
\]
A strong form uses a differential/inequality:
\[
\frac{d}{dt}E_{\ge j}(t) + D_{\ge j}(t) \le F_j(t),
\]
then choose \(B_j\) so that whenever \(E_{\ge j}\) approaches \(B_j\), dissipation dominates.

## 3) Slab induction template
Partition time into slabs \(I_{j,n}=[n\theta 2^{-j},(n+1)\theta 2^{-j}]\).
Define slab dissipation:
\[
D_{\ge j}(I_{j,n}) := \int_{I_{j,n}} D_{\ge j}(t)\,dt.
\]
Self-forming closure (template): if \(E_{\ge j}\) is near the barrier on a slab,
then \(D_{\ge j}(I_{j,n})\) must be large enough to push it back below the barrier
without borrowing from smaller scales.

This produces a uniform tail bound and prevents finite-time cascade \(j\to\infty\).

## 4) How this becomes “coherence”
Define a tail-coherence residual:
\[
r_{\text{tail}}(j,t):=\max(0,\,E_{\ge j}(t)-B_j(t)).
\]
Then tail-debt:
\[
\mathfrak C_{\text{tail}} := \sum_j w_j \sup_{t\in[0,T]} r_{\text{tail}}(j,t)^2.
\]
Gating on \(\mathfrak C_{\text{tail}}\) operationalizes “no cascade” in code:
a solver must reject steps that violate the barrier.

## 5) Certificate style
A barrier proof yields:
- explicit \(B_j(t)\),
- explicit slab size \(\theta\),
- and the constants in the closure inequality.

Those are exactly the data a governed solver can log and test.
