# Stability Theorems for Coherence Enforcement

## Assumptions
Let \((X,d_X)\) be a metric space.
Let \(\mathfrak C:X\to\mathbb R_{\ge 0}\) be debt.
Let \(\mathcal A\subset X\) be the acceptance set induced by gate policy.

Assume:
- (S1) bounded retries: at most \(N_{\text{retry}}\) repair attempts per step.
- (S2) hard legality: rails preserve hard invariants when invoked correctly.
- (S3) contractive repair in debt: successful repair reduces debt as
  \(\mathfrak C(x^{(k+1)}) \le \gamma \mathfrak C(x^{(k)}) + b\) with \(\gamma\in(0,1)\).

## Lemma 1 (Hard invariants persist on accepted steps)
If:
1) the initial state \(x_0\) satisfies \(I_{\text{hard}}(x_0)=\text{true}\),
2) accepted states must satisfy hard invariants,
3) all rails used during repair are hard-legal,
then every accepted state \(x_k\) satisfies \(I_{\text{hard}}(x_k)=\text{true}\).

*Proof:* induction on accepted steps; legality prevents repair from breaking hard invariants.

## Lemma 2 (Bounded work inflation)
With retry cap \(N_{\text{retry}}\), the number of attempts per accepted step is \(\le 1+N_{\text{retry}}\).
So wall-clock work per accepted step is bounded up to a constant multiplicative factor.

## Lemma 3 (Debt boundedness under contractive repair)
Suppose each accepted step satisfies \(\mathfrak C(x)\le \mathfrak C_{\max}\).
Under contractive repair (S3), debt along accepted steps is bounded by:
\[
\mathfrak C(x_k)\le \max\Big(\mathfrak C(x_0),\ \mathfrak C_{\max},\ \frac{b}{1-\gamma}\Big).
\]

*Proof idea:* repeated application of the affine contraction gives a geometric series bound.

## Lemma 4 (Small-gain bound for coupled residual blocks)
Let nonnegative scalars satisfy:
\[
\|r_A\| \le \alpha\|r_B\| + e_A,\quad
\|r_B\| \le \beta\|r_A\| + e_B,
\]
with \(\alpha,\beta\ge 0\) and \(\alpha\beta<1\).
Then:
\[
\|r_A\| \le \frac{\alpha e_B + e_A}{1-\alpha\beta},\quad
\|r_B\| \le \frac{\beta e_A + e_B}{1-\alpha\beta}.
\]

*Proof:* substitute the second inequality into the first and rearrange.

## Theorem (Coherence persistence under gated evolution)
Under S1–S3 and the policy “accept only if \(x\in\mathcal A\)”:
1) no accepted state violates hard invariants,
2) debt remains bounded along accepted states,
3) persistent drift implies persistent residual contribution (it cannot be silent).

This is the mathematical core of “no silent drift”.
